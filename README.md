## **Why I Used Dreamshaper For Inpainting And Its Architecture**

I used **Dreamshaper model** for inpainting because it excels at filling in missing parts of images while making the object and background look natural together. 

### Key Features of Dreamshaper's Architecture:
1. **Encoder-Decoder Process**: It takes an image, processes it to understand important features, and then recreates a more refined version.
2. **Text-Conditioning**: It can generate images based on text prompts, ensuring the output matches the description.
3. **Diffusion Process**: This process cleans up the image, removing noise and making it look smooth and realistic.
4. **Inpainting**: Itâ€™s designed to insert objects into scenes naturally by matching lighting, color, and texture, making the final image look coherent and real.

## **Why I Used Stable Diffusion For Image To Video Conversion & Its Architecture**

I used **Stable Diffusion** for image-to-video conversion because it can generate multiple frames that are consistent, making it easy to create smooth video sequences.

### Key Features of Its Architecture:
1. **Frame Consistency**: It can produce a series of images that look similar enough to create a smooth video.
2. **Diffusion Process**: Just like in inpainting, the diffusion process refines each image to ensure it looks high-quality.
